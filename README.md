# odin-landing-page
Thank you for stopping by! The following is the first website landing project page within the curriculum of The Odin Project.

A couple of friends and I used to talk about creating clothing and outdoor gear company called, "West Coast Milk" (WCM). Customers who would enjoy WCM would be outdoor trekkers, athletes, and all lovers of simplicity of design.

With this project, I will practice some of the skills I have learned so far before moving onto JavaScript!

I will add updates as I go!
